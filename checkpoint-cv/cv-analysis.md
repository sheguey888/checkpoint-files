# 1. Five Mistakes in the Resume

### Mistake 1 — Incorrect grammar and unclear sentences

“Maintained so many customer satisfaction rating…”
“Boosted team efficiency by a high rate…”

### Mistake 2 — LinkedIn URL is invalid

The link contains a space:
`linkedin.com/in/Keith Shannons`

### Mistake 4 — Poor structure and formatting

Name split on two lines, inconsistent spacing, sections too close to each other.

### Mistake 5 — Work experience written as long blocks of text

Descriptions are paragraphs instead of short, clear bullet points.
